# Kaggle-x-Google-5-Day-AI-Agent-Course-notebooks
A complete 5-day learning journey into Google’s Agentic Framework, covering agent fundamentals, memory, tools, observability, and deployment.
This repository contains all notes, exercises, and example implementations created throughout the course.

📚 Course Overview

This 5-day guided program introduces you to modern AI agent development using Google’s GenAI platform and Agent Engine.
By the end of the course, you’ll be able to build, observe, evaluate, and deploy production-grade AI agents.

🗓️ 5-Day Learning Path
🔹 Day 1 — Agent Fundamentals

Introduction to agent architecture

Creating your first agent

Working with system instructions

Adding simple tools (math, search, reasoning helpers)

Understanding the think → plan → act pattern

🔹 Day 2 — Advanced Tools

Creating custom tools

Using built-in tools (code execution, web search, image analysis, etc.)

Tool schemas, safety, and error handling

Best practices for routing tasks to the right tool

Designing robust, multi-step tool workflows

🔹 Day 3 — Sessions & Memory

Understanding session lifecycles

Implementing short-term conversation memory

Creating long-term knowledge storage

Using vector memory with embedding models

Memory deduplication and retrieval strategies

Making agents stateful and context-aware

🔹 Day 4 — Observability & Evaluation

Monitoring agent behavior through traces

Logging tool calls, decisions, and internal states

Debugging agent failures and loops

Evaluating agent performance and latency

Automated test cases and quality benchmarks

Human-in-the-loop evaluation patterns

🔹 Day 5 — Production Deployment

Understanding the Agent Engine

Deploying agents to production endpoints

Versioning and lifecycle management

Secure API exposure

Scaling agents in real-world applications

Best practices for reliability and cost-optimization
