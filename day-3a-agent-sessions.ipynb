The goal is to significantly reduce the time, cost, and failure rates associated with bringing new medicines to patients.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation** development. This is a critical area because identifying the right biological target is the foundational step for creating any new drug. If you aim at the wrong target, the drug won't work, or worse, could cause harm.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what's happening in AI-driven target identification and validation:\n\n**The Traditional Challenge:**\n\n*   **Complexity of Biology:** Biological systems are incredibly intricate. Diseases often involve multiple genes, proteins, pathways, and cellular processes interacting in complex ways.\n*   **Vast Amount of Data:** The sheer volume of biological data generated from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and clinical studies is overwhelming for human researchers to analyze comprehensively.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many disease-related proteins have historically been considered difficult to target with conventional drugs due to their structure or function.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing This:**\n\n1.  **Multi-omics Integration and Pattern Recognition:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI, particularly machine learning algorithms, excels at finding patterns and correlations within massive, disparate datasets. In this context, it means AI can analyze data from:\n        *   **Genomics:** Studying an individual's or a population's DNA to find gene variations linked to disease.\n        *   **Transcriptomics:** Analyzing RNA to understand which genes are actively being expressed (turned \"on\") in specific cells or tissues under different conditions (e.g., healthy vs. diseased).\n        *   **Proteomics:** Studying the complete set of proteins produced by an organism, as proteins are often the direct effectors of cellular function and the ultimate targets of drugs.\n        *   **Metabolomics:** Analyzing small molecules (metabolites) to understand cellular processes and metabolic pathways.\n        *   **Clinical Data:** Patient health records, imaging data, symptoms, and treatment outcomes.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI can identify subtle, complex relationships between genetic mutations, altered protein levels, metabolic changes, and disease phenotypes that might be missed by traditional statistical methods. For example, AI can uncover a specific protein whose altered expression across multiple \"omics\" layers is strongly correlated with a particular cancer subtype.\n\n2.  **Unraveling Disease Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Network Biology:** AI can construct and analyze complex biological networks (e.g., protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks). By mapping these networks, researchers can understand how different components of a cell or organism are connected and how disruptions in one area can cascade and lead to disease.\n    *   **Identifying Key Nodes:** AI can highlight \"central\" or \"bottleneck\" proteins or genes within these networks that, if modulated, could have a significant impact on the disease process. These are prime candidates for drug targets.\n    *   **Causal Inference:** Advanced AI techniques are starting to move beyond correlation to infer causality, helping researchers understand *why* certain biological changes lead to disease, not just that they are associated.\n\n3.  **Predicting Targetability:**\n    *   **What is \"Druggable\"?** A target is considered \"druggable\" if a molecule can be designed to bind to it with sufficient affinity and specificity to modulate its activity (either inhibit or activate it). Many proteins, especially those in the cell nucleus or on the cell surface, have complex binding sites that are challenging to target.\n    *   **AI for Predicting Druggability:** AI models can be trained on vast datasets of known drug targets and their properties. They can then analyze the structural and functional characteristics of newly identified potential targets to predict:\n        *   Whether a small molecule or biologic is likely to bind effectively.\n        *   The types of binding sites available.\n        *   Potential challenges in achieving selectivity (binding only to the desired target and not others).\n\n**Concrete Examples and Impact:**\n\n*   **Identifying novel cancer targets:** AI has been instrumental in identifying new oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that were not previously known to be critical drivers of cancer growth.\n*   **Uncovering targets for neurodegenerative diseases:** Diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's involve complex biological mechanisms. AI is helping researchers sift through vast amounts of genetic and proteomic data to find potential targets for therapies.\n*   **Discovering targets for rare diseases:** For rare diseases, where patient populations are small and data is scarce, AI can pool and analyze data from various sources to identify potential therapeutic avenues that would be impossible otherwise.\n\n**In essence, AI acts as a super-powered detective, sifting through mountains of biological evidence to find the crucial clues that point to the most promising targets for drug development. This significantly accelerates the initial, and often most challenging, phase of bringing a new medicine from concept to reality.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven target identification and validation is diverse, ranging from **established pharmaceutical giants** to **specialized AI drug discovery startups**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
