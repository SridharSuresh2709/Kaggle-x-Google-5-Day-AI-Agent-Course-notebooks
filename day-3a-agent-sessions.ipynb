    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The field of AI in healthcare is rapidly evolving, with new developments emerging constantly. Here's a summary of some of the latest and most significant trends and news:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Areas of Advancement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug Discovery and Development:** AI is dramatically accelerating the process of identifying potential drug candidates, predicting their efficacy, and optimizing clinical trial design. Companies are using AI to analyze vast datasets of biological information, patient genomics, and chemical structures to find novel treatments for diseases.\n",
      "    *   **News Example:** Companies like **Recursion Pharmaceuticals** and **Exscientia** are continuously announcing breakthroughs using AI to identify new drug targets and design novel molecules for various conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders.\n",
      "*   **Diagnostics and Imaging:** AI algorithms are becoming increasingly adept at analyzing medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, pathology slides) to detect diseases earlier and more accurately than human interpretation alone. This includes identifying subtle patterns indicative of conditions like cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "    *   **News Example:** Recent studies and FDA approvals highlight AI tools that can assist radiologists in detecting lung nodules, breast cancer, and even predicting stroke risk from brain scans.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Medicine and Treatment Planning:** AI is crucial in analyzing individual patient data (genomics, medical history, lifestyle factors) to tailor treatment plans for maximum effectiveness and minimal side effects. This is particularly impactful in oncology, where AI can help predict which therapies will work best for a specific patient's tumor.\n",
      "    *   **News Example:** AI platforms are being developed to analyze tumor genetic profiles and recommend the most suitable targeted therapies or immunotherapy regimens.\n",
      "*   **Robotic Surgery and Medical Devices:** AI is enhancing the capabilities of surgical robots, providing surgeons with greater precision, improved visualization, and even predictive analytics during procedures. AI is also being integrated into a wider range of medical devices for monitoring patients, delivering therapies, and assisting with rehabilitation.\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned regarding AI in drug discovery: **Predicting Protein Structures with Higher Accuracy, exemplified by AlphaFold.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a foundational advancement that has profound implications for drug discovery, even if it's not directly designing the drug molecule itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are Proteins and Why is Their Structure Important?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Proteins are the workhorses of our cells.** They perform an incredible array of functions: catalyzing biochemical reactions (enzymes), transporting molecules, providing structural support, transmitting signals, and much more.\n",
      "*   **A protein's function is intimately tied to its 3D shape (its structure).** If a protein misfolds or its shape is altered, it can lead to disease.\n",
      "*   **Drug targets are often proteins.** To design a drug that can treat a disease, scientists need to understand how the target protein works and what its structure looks like. A drug molecule is designed to bind to a specific part of a protein, altering its activity (e.g., blocking it, activating it, or stabilizing it).\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Challenge of Protein Structure Prediction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Experimentally determining protein structure is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive.** Techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) are powerful but require specific conditions, pure protein samples, and significant expertise. It can take years to determine the structure of a single protein.\n",
      "*   **The human genome encodes tens of thousands of proteins.** Even with experimental methods, we've only solved the structures of a fraction of them. This leaves a massive knowledge gap when it comes to understanding disease mechanisms and finding new drug targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI, Specifically AlphaFold, Changed the Game:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **AlphaFold (developed by DeepMind, a Google AI company) is an AI system that can predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence with remarkable accuracy.** Essentially, it takes the linear string of amino acids that make up a protein and predicts how they will fold up into a complex 3D shape.\n",
      "*   **Accuracy:** For many proteins, AlphaFold's predictions are as accurate as experimentally determined structures. This was a groundbreaking achievement, solving a problem that had eluded scientists for decades.\n",
      "*   **Speed and Scale:** AlphaFold can predict structures orders of magnitude faster than experimental methods. This allows researchers to generate structural hypotheses for vast numbers of proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact on Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "    *   If a disease is linked to a malfunctioning protein, and its structure wasn't known experimentally, researchers can now use AlphaFold to get a highly accurate 3D model.\n",
      "    *   This model helps researchers understand *how* the protein is malfunctioning and identify specific sites where a drug could interact.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Informed Drug Design:**\n",
      "    *   Once a target protein's structure is predicted, computational chemists and AI algorithms can begin designing small molecules (potential drugs) that are complementary in shape and chemical properties to the protein's binding sites. This is like designing a key to fit a specific lock.\n",
      "    *   AI models can then be used to predict how well these designed molecules will bind to the target protein, and to optimize their properties for efficacy and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:**\n",
      "    *   By providing structural insights into proteins involved in disease, AI helps researchers gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biological processes, which can lead to entirely new therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Drug Repurposing:**\n",
      "    *   If a drug is known to bind to a protein with a similar structure to a new disease target, it might suggest the existing drug could be repurposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Democratization of Structural Biology:**\n",
      "    *   DeepMind made the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database publicly available, containing predictions for over 200 million proteins. This resource has dramatically lowered the barrier to entry for researchers worldwide, empowering them to explore protein structures without needing access to expensive experimental equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Use Cases:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Understanding infectious diseases:** Predicting the structure of viral proteins helps in designing antivirals and vaccines.\n",
      "*   **Developing cancer therapies:** Understanding the structure of mutated cancer-driving proteins.\n",
      "*   **Tackling neurological disorders:** Investigating the misfolding of proteins implicated in diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, AlphaFold and similar AI-driven structure prediction tools are not directly *making* drugs, but they are providing the essential structural blueprints that make the design of new, effective drugs possible and dramatically faster.** It's like giving architects detailed maps of a building site, allowing them to design the perfect structure much more efficiently.\n",

    "In this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",
