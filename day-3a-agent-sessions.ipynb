    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "**3. Accelerated Preclinical Testing and Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** AI is being used to predict the efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties (how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted) of drug candidates *before* they reach expensive and time-consuming laboratory or clinical testing.\n",
      "*   **Why it matters:** This helps researchers prioritize the most promising candidates and weed out those likely to fail early on, saving significant time and resources.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** Many AI drug discovery platforms integrate these prediction capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs with AI:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** AI can analyze vast amounts of data on existing drugs (their molecular structure, known side effects, approved indications) and match them to new disease indications based on underlying biological mechanisms or patient data.\n",
      "*   **Why it matters:** This is a faster and less risky path to new treatments because the safety profile of existing drugs is already well-established.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** This is a common application across many AI drug discovery companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Advancements in AI for Biologics (Antibodies, Proteins):**\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation**. Let's dive deeper into that.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we go further, it's crucial to understand what a drug target is. In simple terms, a drug target is a specific molecule in the body (usually a protein, but sometimes RNA or DNA) that a drug is designed to interact with. This interaction is intended to produce a therapeutic effect, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Inhibiting** the activity of a harmful enzyme.\n",
      "*   **Activating** a beneficial receptor.\n",
      "*   **Blocking** a signaling pathway that contributes to disease.\n",
      "*   **Delivering** a drug payload to a specific location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding the *right* target is arguably the most critical first step in drug discovery. If you target the wrong molecule, the drug won't work, or it might have unintended and harmful side effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, identifying drug targets relied on a combination of serendipity, hypothesis-driven research, and painstaking laboratory experiments. AI changes this by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Analyzing Massive, Multi-Omics Datasets:**\n",
      "    *   **Genomics:** AI can sift through the entire human genome (and the genomes of pathogens) to identify genes that are mutated or expressed differently in diseased states compared to healthy ones.\n",
      "    *   **Proteomics:** It can analyze the proteins present in cells or tissues, identifying which proteins are over- or under-expressed, or are modified in ways that suggest a role in disease.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomics:** AI examines RNA levels to understand which genes are actively being transcribed into proteins.\n",
      "    *   **Metabolomics:** Analyzing the small molecules (metabolites) involved in biological processes to understand pathway disruptions.\n",
      "    *   **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):** AI can analyze anonymized patient data to find correlations between genetic markers, symptoms, disease progression, and treatment responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Uncovering Complex Biological Pathways:**\n",
      "    *   Diseases are rarely caused by a single faulty gene or protein. They often arise from intricate networks of interactions. AI can map these complex biological pathways, identifying **bottlenecks, control points, or critical nodes** that, if modulated by a drug, could restore health.\n",
      "    *   It can identify **disease drivers** that might not be immediately obvious through traditional linear thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting Causality vs. Correlation:**\n",
      "    *   A major challenge in analyzing biological data is distinguishing between a marker that *correlates* with a disease and one that actually *causes* or *drives* it. AI algorithms can be trained to look for patterns that suggest causal relationships, making them more reliable for target selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Identifying Novel Targets:**\n",
      "    *   AI can identify entirely new protein targets that were previously unknown or unappreciated for their role in a disease. This opens up new avenues for therapeutic intervention that wouldn't have been considered before.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Prioritizing and Validating Targets:**\n",
      "    *   Once potential targets are identified, AI can help prioritize them based on various criteria:\n",
      "        *   **\"Druggability\":** How likely is it that a small molecule or biologic can bind to and modulate this target?\n",
      "        *   **Likelihood of therapeutic success:** Based on existing data, how probable is it that targeting this molecule will lead to a beneficial outcome?\n",
      "        *   **Safety profile:** Are there known off-target effects or potential toxicities associated with modulating this target?\n",
      "    *   AI can also guide experimental validation by suggesting specific experiments to confirm a target's role.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Companies Leading the Way:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **BenevolentAI:** This company is a prime example, using its AI platform to mine vast scientific literature and data to identify novel drug targets and disease hypotheses. They have successfully discovered potential targets for conditions like ALS.\n",

      "*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Recursion uses AI and machine learning on cellular imaging data (phenotypic screening) to identify both targets and potential drug candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI-powered target identification has the potential to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Reduce the time and cost** of the early stages of drug discovery.\n",
      "*   **Increase the success rate** of drug development by ensuring that researchers are working on the most promising targets.\n",
      "*   **Unlock new therapeutic possibilities** for diseases that have been historically difficult to treat.\n",

    "1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n",
    "2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n",
    "3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n"
