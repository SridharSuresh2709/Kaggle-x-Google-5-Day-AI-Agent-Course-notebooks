    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **De Novo Drug Design and Optimization** development in AI-driven drug discovery. This is a really exciting area that represents a significant leap forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is \"De Novo\" Drug Design?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **\"De Novo\"** is Latin for \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\"\n",
      "*   In drug discovery, traditional methods often involve screening existing libraries of compounds or modifying known drugs.\n",
      "*   **De Novo drug design**, powered by AI, means designing a drug molecule *from scratch*, specifically tailored to fit and interact with a particular biological target (like a protein involved in a disease).\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI Enables De Novo Drug Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI algorithms, particularly **generative models**, are trained on massive datasets of known molecules and their properties, as well as structural information about biological targets. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Target Understanding:** First, researchers need to identify and characterize the biological target (e.g., a protein). This involves understanding its 3D structure, its function, and how it contributes to disease.\n",
      "2.  **Generative Model Training:** AI models (like Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, Variational Autoencoders - VAEs, or Transformer-based models) are trained on vast chemical databases (millions of known molecules) and their associated data (e.g., chemical properties, binding affinities).\n",
      "3.  **Designing from Scratch:**\n",
      "    *   The AI is then prompted with specific **design criteria**. These criteria can include:\n",
      "        *   **Target Binding:** The molecule must bind strongly to the specific active site of the target protein.\n",
      "        *   **Desired Properties:** The molecule should have good solubility, be able to cross cell membranes, be metabolically stable (not break down too quickly in the body), and have low predicted toxicity.\n",
      "        *   **Novelty:** The molecule should ideally be structurally unique to avoid existing patents or known off-target effects.\n",
      "    *   The AI then *generates* entirely new molecular structures that aim to meet these criteria. It's like a molecular architect designing a perfect key for a specific lock.\n",
      "4.  **Virtual Screening and Optimization:**\n",
      "    *   The generated molecules are then put through extensive *virtual screening* using other AI models. These models predict how well the generated molecule will bind to the target, its ADME properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion), and its potential toxicity.\n",
      "    *   Based on these predictions, the AI can either select the most promising candidates or **optimize** the generated molecules. Optimization might involve making slight tweaks to the molecular structure to improve certain properties.\n",
      "5.  **Synthesis and Experimental Validation:**\n",
      "    *   Finally, the AI-generated, optimized candidates are synthesized in the lab and tested experimentally to confirm the AI's predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this a Big Deal?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** Traditional de novo design is incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive. AI can generate and evaluate thousands or millions of potential molecules in a fraction of the time.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** AI can explore chemical spaces that human chemists might not intuitively consider, leading to truly novel drug candidates. This is crucial for tackling diseases where existing drugs are ineffective or resistance has developed.\n",
      "*   **Precision:** By designing molecules with specific properties from the outset, AI aims to create drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects from the very beginning.\n",
      "*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** By reducing the number of compounds that need to be synthesized and tested, AI de novo design can significantly lower the cost of early-stage drug discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Companies Focusing on This:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Exscientia:** They were one of the first to have an AI-designed drug enter clinical trials. They use AI to design novel molecules from scratch.\n",
      "*   **BenevolentAI:** They integrate AI across the entire discovery pipeline, including de novo design.\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** They have a platform specifically for generative AI-driven drug discovery and have reported success in identifying novel targets and designing drug candidates.\n",
      "*   **Schrödinger:** While known for physics-based simulations, they also incorporate AI to enhance their de novo design capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI de novo drug design is moving drug discovery from a process of *searching* for existing solutions to a process of *creating* bespoke solutions precisely for a given problem. It's a powerful shift that promises to accelerate the development of new therapies.\n",
